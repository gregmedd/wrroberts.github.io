### [TACOCAT](https://github.com/wrroberts/TACOCAT)
**T**rim **A**nd **CO**nstruct **C**ombined **A**ssembly **T**ranscriptome

TACOCAT was built to streamline the de novo transcriptome assembly process and create a robust reference for downstream analysis. This pipeline starts with raw paired-end Illumina reads in fastq format, quality trims the reads, assembles the reads using multiple assemblers and different k-mer sizes, and outputs a reference classified into primary and alternate sets of transcripts.
