I am a Ph.D. Candidate, working in the [Roalson Lab](http://roalsonlab.weebly.com) at [Washington State University School of Biological Sciences](http://www.sbs.wsu.edu). I use bioinformatic, computational, and genomic approaches to understand patterns of diversification and the evolutionary and ecological processes that generate them.
