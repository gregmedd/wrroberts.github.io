I am a Ph.D. Candidate, working in the [Roalson Lab](http://roalsonlab.weebly.com) at [Washington State University School of Biological Sciences](http://www.sbs.wsu.edu). I combine bioinformatics, genomics, and phylogenetics to understand patterns of biological diversification and the evolutionary and ecological processes that generate them.
